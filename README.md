📊 **Binomial and Poisson Distribution – Python Implementation**

This repository contains Python-based implementations of Binomial Distribution and Poisson Distribution using Jupyter Notebooks.
The project demonstrates statistical modeling, probability estimation, and data visualization techniques relevant to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

📘 **_Binomial Distribution (binomial.ipynb)_**
The notebook focuses on modeling discrete random variables using the Binomial Distribution.

- Key Features:
 - Simulation of Bernoulli trials using NumPy
 - Estimation of probabilities through large-scale experiments
 - Calculation of frequency and relative frequency
 - Visualization of binomial probability distributions
 - Histogram-based analysis of large binomial samples

- Use Cases Covered:
 - Coin toss probability experiments
 - Multi-trial binomial simulations
 - Customer purchase probability modeling

📙 **_Poisson Distribution (poisson.ipynb)_**
This notebook demonstrates the Poisson Distribution, commonly used to model the frequency of events occurring per unit time or space.

- Key Features:
 - Simulation of event occurrences using Poisson distribution
 - Computation of total, frequency, and relative frequency of events
 - Visualization of probability distribution using bar charts

- Use Case:
 - Modeling the number of placements occurring per day
